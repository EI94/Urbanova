# 🛡️ GitHub Status Checks Protection Setup

## 📋 Overview

This document provides instructions for setting up required status checks protection on the main branch to ensure code quality and deployment safety.

## 🎯 Required Status Checks

The following status checks must be enabled and required for the `main` branch:

### **1. CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)**

- **Purpose**: Validates code quality, runs tests, and builds the application
- **Triggers**: Pull requests and pushes to main/develop
- **Jobs**:
  - TypeScript type checking
  - ESLint code quality
  - Unit tests with coverage
  - Application build
  - Security audit
  - Bundle analysis (PR only)
  - Performance tests (PR only)

### **2. Preview Smoke Tests (`preview-smoke.yml`)**

- **Purpose**: Validates that Vercel preview deployments are working correctly
- **Triggers**: Vercel deployment status events
- **Tests**:
  - Health endpoint availability
  - Critical API endpoints
  - Frontend page accessibility
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Security headers

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Enable Branch Protection Rules**

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main` branch
4. Configure the following settings:

### **Step 2: Configure Protection Settings**

```yaml
Branch Protection Rule for 'main':

✅ Require a pull request before merging
  - Required number of reviewers: 1
  - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from code owners

✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - ci.yml (CI Pipeline)
    - preview-smoke.yml (Preview Smoke Tests)

✅ Require conversation resolution before merging

✅ Require signed commits (optional but recommended)

✅ Require linear history (optional but recommended)

✅ Include administrators (recommended)
```

### **Step 3: Required Status Checks Configuration**

In the **"Require status checks to pass before merging"** section:

1. ✅ Check **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**
2. ✅ Check **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
3. Add the following required status checks:
   - `ci.yml` - CI Pipeline
   - `preview-smoke.yml` - Preview Smoke Tests

### **Step 4: Advanced Settings (Optional)**

```yaml
Additional Protection Settings:

✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
✅ Require deployments to succeed before merging
✅ Lock branch (prevents force pushes)
✅ Allow force pushes (disable for main branch)
✅ Allow deletions (disable for main branch)
```

## 🚀 Workflow Integration

### **Pull Request Flow**

1. **Developer creates PR** → Triggers `ci.yml`
2. **CI Pipeline runs** → Type check, lint, test, build
3. **PR approved** → Ready for merge
4. **Merge to main** → Triggers Vercel deployment
5. **Vercel deploys** → Triggers `preview-smoke.yml`
6. **Smoke tests pass** → Deployment validated

### **Direct Push to Main (if allowed)**

1. **Direct push** → Triggers `ci.yml`
2. **CI Pipeline runs** → All checks must pass
3. **Vercel deploys** → Triggers `preview-smoke.yml`
4. **Smoke tests pass** → Deployment validated

## 📊 Status Check Details

### **CI Pipeline Status Checks**

| Check             | Description                          | Failure Impact  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `TypeScript`      | Type checking across all packages    | ❌ Block merge  |
| `ESLint`          | Code quality and style validation    | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Tests`           | Unit tests with coverage reporting   | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Build`           | Application build verification       | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Security`        | Dependency vulnerability scan        | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Bundle Analysis` | Bundle size and performance analysis | ⚠️ Warning only |
| `Performance`     | Lighthouse performance tests         | ⚠️ Warning only |

### **Preview Smoke Tests Status Checks**

| Check              | Description                          | Failure Impact  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `Health Check`     | API health endpoint availability     | ❌ Block merge  |
| `API Endpoints`    | Critical API endpoints functionality | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Frontend Pages`   | Key frontend pages accessibility     | ❌ Block merge  |
| `Performance`      | Response time validation             | ⚠️ Warning only |
| `Security Headers` | Security headers presence            | ⚠️ Warning only |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Status checks not appearing**
   - Ensure workflows are in `.github/workflows/`
   - Check workflow syntax with GitHub Actions validator
   - Verify workflow files are committed to the branch

2. **Required checks not blocking merges**
   - Verify branch protection rules are enabled
   - Check that status checks are marked as "required"
   - Ensure "Require branches to be up to date" is enabled

3. **Preview smoke tests not triggering**
   - Verify Vercel is configured to send deployment status events
   - Check that environment is named "Preview"
   - Ensure webhook permissions are correct

### **Status Check Commands**

```bash
# Check workflow syntax locally
npx @github/action-validator .github/workflows/ci.yml
npx @github/action-validator .github/workflows/preview-smoke.yml

# Test workflow locally (requires act)
npx act pull_request
npx act deployment_status

# Check branch protection status
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerts

### **GitHub Notifications**

Configure notifications for:

- Failed status checks
- Required review requests
- Branch protection rule changes

### **Slack/Teams Integration**

Set up webhooks to notify teams when:

- CI pipeline fails
- Smoke tests fail
- Deployments are blocked

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always require status checks** for main branch
2. **Keep required checks minimal** but comprehensive
3. **Monitor status check performance** and optimize as needed
4. **Regularly review and update** protection rules
5. **Document any changes** to the protection setup
